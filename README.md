Overview:

This project analyzes travel booking data to uncover insights about family and non-family travelers. Using Python, I explored differences in booking behaviors, revenue patterns, and planning habits. The results highlight actionable strategies that could help travel companies, like Expedia, enhance customer experiences and drive growth.

Key Objectives:

- Understand booking patterns for family and non-family travelers.
- Explore monthly trends in net orders and gross booking amounts.
- Provide actionable recommendations to optimize marketing and loyalty strategies.

Tools Used:

Programming Languages:
- Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Libraries:
- Pandas: To clean and manipulate the data.
- Matplotlib: For creating detailed, visually appealing charts.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and calculations.

Analysis and Insights:
1. Monthly Net Orders and Gross Booking Amount:
- What the chart shows: Monthly trends in bookings and revenue from June 2018 to June 2019.
- Key Insight: Net orders increased by 14.7%, and gross booking revenue rose by 35%. This indicates growing travel demand, particularly during mid-year months.

2. Family vs Non-Family Travelers
- What the chart shows: Comparison of total bookings and revenue for family and non-family travelers.
- Key Insight: Non-family travelers contributed over 80% of bookings and generated three times the revenue of family travelers.

3. Average Length of Stay and Booking Window
What the chart shows: Differences in how far in advance family and non-family travelers book and how long they stay.
Key Insight:
- Families book further in advance (26.8 days on average) compared to non-families (23.2 days).
- Both groups have similar lengths of stay (around 2.7 days).
