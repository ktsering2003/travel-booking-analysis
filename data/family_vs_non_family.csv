Summary for Task1 : 
In the second part of Task 1, 
I compared booking data based on whether there was a family
presence (with or without children). 
I grouped the data by family presence and calculated the 
total net orders and total gross booking amount for both 
"Family" and "Non-Family" groups. The resulting bar graph,
with blue bars for Net Orders and green bars for Gross 
Booking Amount, allows a clear visual comparison of family
vs. non-family bookings. 
I labeled each bar with its value for easy reference and 
formatted the y-axis to show billions, 
as the values are large.
