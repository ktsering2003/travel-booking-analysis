# Summary for task 1 for part 1:
In the first part of Task 1, I analyzed the monthly trends 
for net orders and gross booking amounts. 
I grouped the data by month-year to sum up the total 
net orders and gross booking amount for each month. 
Then, I created a bar graph with two y-axes: 
the left y-axis for Net Orders (displayed in blue) 
and the right y-axis for Gross Booking Amount 
(displayed in green). This dual-axis approach allowed me 
to show both metrics side by side, 
making it easy to compare trends over time. 
I added labels to each bar to clearly show the exact values,
improving readability.
